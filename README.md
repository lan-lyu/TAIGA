## For Google Search

Replace the API key and CX in `js/imageSearch.js` with yours. 


```
    const apiKey = "";
    const cx = "";
```

You can get one by visiting https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/introduction.

Then on the page `/search-2-google` the right part search shows google search results.
